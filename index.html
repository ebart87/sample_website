        <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more.

                HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Tim-Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the <a href="http://www.softcover.io">Softcover Publishing Platform</a>. This page is part of the sample site for <a href="http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial"><em>Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong>per<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage, the universal language of the World Wide Web.

        <h2>Founder</h2>
        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit <strong><em>at least a billion people</em></strong>, and probably more.

            Michael is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and a principal author on <a href="learnenough.com">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of <a href="http://kravmaga.com">Krav Maga</a> and has a three step plan for world domination. Rumors that he is a secret supervillian are slightly exaggerated.

        <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
        <p>
            When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

        <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
        <p>
            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
      Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
      at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
      tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
